[LINKEDIN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshita-s-13b239251/details/projects/)

To complete this project, I used the LSTM(Long Short Tome Memory) model for the prediction of stock prices.

Skills:

Python3
Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Machine Learning Algorithm
Long Short Time Memory (LSTM)
This Notebook shows:

Data Handling

Data Analysis:
Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a model that increases the memory of recurrent neural networks. Recurrent neural networks hold short-term memory in that they allow earlier determining information to be employed in the current neural networks.
